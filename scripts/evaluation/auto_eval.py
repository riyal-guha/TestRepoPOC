-- You DO NOT NEED to interact with web pages or perform actions such as booking flights or conducting searches on websites.
-- You SHOULD NOT make assumptions based on information not presented in the screenshot when comparing it to the instructions. If you cannot find any information in the screenshot that matches the instruction, you can believe the information in the response.
-- Your primary responsibility is to conduct a thorough assessment of the web task instruction against the outcome depicted in the screenshot and in the response, evaluating whether the actions taken align with the given instructions.
-- NOTE that the instruction may involve more than one task, for example, locating the garage and summarizing the review. Failing to complete either task, such as not providing a summary, should be considered unsuccessful.
-- NOTE that the screenshot is authentic, but the response provided by LLM is generated at the end of web browsing, and there may be discrepancies between the text and the screenshots.
-- Note the difference: 1) Result response may contradict the screenshot, then the content of the screenshot prevails, 2) The content in the Result response is not mentioned on the screenshot, choose to believe the content.
-- If you are not sure whether you should believe the content in the response, you should choose unknown.
You will be shown a web automation task and the output of two AI agents trying to complete that task.

For **each agent**, evaluate:
1. How well the agent followed the task instruction.
2. If the final textual result matches the task.
3. Whether screenshots support that the task was executed correctly.
4. Provide a **verdict**: SUCCESS / NOT SUCCESS / UNKNOWN.
5. Provide a **confidence score (0-100)** for each agent.

Format your response like this:

Agent 1:
- Evaluation: ...
- Verdict: ...
- Confidence Score: ...

Agent 2:
- Evaluation: ...
- Verdict: ...
- Confidence Score: ...

Only use screenshots and textual output to make your judgment. Prefer screenshots if thereâ€™s a conflict. If unsure, mark as UNKNOWN.
