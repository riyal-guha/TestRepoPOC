The screenshots confirm this; they show a Best Sellers page for \"Computer Memory\" on Amazon.in (Indian Amazon site), not the US Amazon site (amazon.com) as requested, and display listings for RAM, not laptops.\n\nTherefore, the task was NOT SUCCESSFUL due to the incorrect URL provided (implicitly, as no URL is explicitly shown in the prompt).
